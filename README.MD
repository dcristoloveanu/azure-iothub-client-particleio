# Microsoft Azure IoT SDKs

*Warning: experimental port*

This repository contains the IoT device SDK for IoTHub from https://www.github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks ported to particle.io.
Some limitations exist for the port:
- only AMQP is supported
- only the LL layer is supported (no threading and locking).
